STEP 1: Set Up JavaFX in Your Project
Use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.
Install JavaFX SDK.
Configure:
Add JavaFX libraries to your project.
Set VM options to include JavaFX modules.
ðŸ§  Optional: Use a JavaFX-enabled build tool like Maven or Gradle for easier dependency management.

STEP 2: Plan the App Layout (UI Design)
Design your UI components:
Label to show the countdown timer
Buttons:
Start
Pause
Reset
Label or Counter for number of Pomodoro sessions completed
Optional:
Progress bar / circle
Drop-downs for customizing session time
Use FXML or build the UI programmatically.

STEP 3: Create the Timer Logic (Model) **HERE**
Create a Timer engine that:
Counts down from a set time
Updates every second
Switches between work and break sessions
Track:
Time remaining
Session type (work/break)
Number of completed work sessions
Use Timeline, PauseTransition, or ScheduledExecutorService for the timer.

STEP 4: Connect Logic to UI (Controller)
Link Start/Pause/Reset buttons to control the timer.
Update the label in real-time to show countdown.
Toggle between work and break session messages.

STEP 5: Add Session Flow Management
Work session â†’ short break (e.g., 5 mins)
After 4 work sessions â†’ long break (e.g., 15 mins)
Reset session counter after long break
Keep user informed of the current state

STEP 6: Optional Features
Sound alert when session ends (JavaFX Media or AudioClip)
User settings screen (custom durations)
Dark/light mode toggle
Task list or history tracker
Simple chart of progress (if you want analytics later)

STEP 7: Test and Polish
Run through all features:
Timer behavior
UI updates
Session transitions
Improve UX with animations or transitions if needed

STEP 8: Package Your App
Export the project as a runnable .jar
Or bundle with JavaFX runtime using tools like jlink or jpackage
